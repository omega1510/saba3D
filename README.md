- This is not a project that is owned by SABA (Shia Association of the Bay Area), but we do have approval to make a 3D model. We might use this model in future to make promos, maps, and more for SABA.

- We try our best to make everything as accurate as possible, but not all items are created to scale. Some items are removed/improved for better visual pleasure. 

- If you have any questions, complaints, or ideas, feel free to email mhadiyusufali@gmail.com and we will answer you ASAP.
