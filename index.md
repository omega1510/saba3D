## Welcome to SABA3D

### _Imagine Your Local Community Center - Mosque, Library, Events, & More._

Now imagine that you want to share it with the rest of the world. How would you go about doing so?

### A 3D World...

Imagine a world, where you open up your browser, type in saba3d.xyz (or something like that), and there you have it. The earth. Zoom in - California. Zoom in - Saba IGC. Every room in 3D. In your control.

Introducing Saba3D, coming this year, a collaboration between Hayaan and Muhammad Hadi.
